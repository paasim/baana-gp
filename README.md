# Modeling cyclist count with Gaussian Processes in Stan

Testing out GPs in [Stan](https://github.com/stan-dev). 

The repository contains R-scripts for downloading the data and fitting a GP with a periodic component for the day-of-the-week and an exponential quadratic component for the rain and temperature on [baana usage data](https://www.avoindata.fi/data/en/dataset/helsingin-pyorailijamaarat).
