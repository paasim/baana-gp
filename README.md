# Modeling cyclist count with Gaussian Processes in Stan

Testing out GPs in [Stan](https://github.com/stan-dev). 

The repository contains R-scripts for downloading the data and fitting a GP with a periodic component for the day-of-the-week and an exponential quadratic component for the rain and temperature on [baana usage data](https://www.avoindata.fi/data/en/dataset/helsingin-pyorailijamaarat).

For results, see either the document analysis.pdf or click [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/paasim/baana-gp/b172fcba/analysis.html) for an html-version.
